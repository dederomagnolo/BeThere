# BeThere

Hello!

This is my personal IoT solution to automate a garden. 

Development:

- Local Station (Arduino and necessary Circuits): Responsible to collect data from the garden and send it to the cloud application. The controls of the water pump is necessary too.
- Web page and Android App: Interfaces to visualize data from the cloud and control the local station hardware remotely.

All explanations and progress you can see at the project wordpress page:
